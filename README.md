# 📖 To Do List <a name="about-project"></a>
<br>
<br>
The To-Do List Project, created solely by me, showcases my skills in JavaScript ES6, HTML, CSS, and my ability to use Webpack for an efficient development workflow. This web-page demonstrates a simple, user-friendly to-do list management system, allowing users to add, complete, and remove tasks dynamically. The project highlights my commitment to continuous learning and independent web development.
